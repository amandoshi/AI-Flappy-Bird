An endless Flappy Bird AI that learns through genetic evolution (no cross-breeding). The neural network uses the sigmoid activation function and 
1-hidden layer, with 5 nodes. Both the neural network and matrix operations are coded without libraries for learning purposes. This project and code was inspired by The Coding Train.
